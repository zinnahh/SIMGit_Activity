Hello,Git! 

ORTIZ, ZYNNAH MARIE G.
CS3C 

1. What challenges did you face during this activity?
- I'm still having some confusion regarding the starting point of the activity. I've requested assistance from Gemini to help me understand.

2. Which Git command was the most confusing
- The git add hello command does not execute the hello file, even though I added it to my folder. So what I did is prompting the echo command and add the file. 

3. How can version control help in real-world software development?
- It helps team collaboration by managing conflicts and modifications. Also, it allows easy reversion.
